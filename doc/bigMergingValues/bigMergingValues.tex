	\chapter{Big merging values through small cycles -bv}
	
	Another implementation of -mv. The difference is that this operation does more -mv operations in one steps. Extending of the plan is done by extending given plan by reverse operations in the spite of -mv that are processed in reversed order than reductions were made.
	
	\section{Implementation notes}
	Note that the implementation may need two calls to example such there are actions $a_1:0 \rightarrow 1$, $a_2:1 \rightarrow 0$, $a_3:1 \rightarrow 2$, $a_4:2 \rightarrow 0$ (actions switch the same variable, no preconditions). The implementation will return only one reverse operation of -bv if the actions will be processed in sequences like $a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4$ or $a_2, a_1, a_4, a_3$, etc. But in case that the actions will be processed in sequences like $a_3, a_4, a_1, a2$ or $a_4, a_3, a_2, a1$, etc., there will be two -bv reverse operation returned because it does when merging $a_1$ and $a_2$ it does not further look to the memory if stored actions (that happens in the second case) can be merged.
