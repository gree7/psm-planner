\chapter{Single first action merge with start -sf}
	
If there is only one action that is applicable in start and goal is not subset of init, then such action can be executed because there is no other possibility to get from init to goal. While -ai removes applied action from SAS, this reduction does not removes applied action. 

Please TODO.
