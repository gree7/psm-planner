# Set up Maven #
################

# Note that the maven needs to be set up to connect to ATG repositories to can get dependencies for project:
# The file "settings.xml" is placed in ".m2" directory.
#
#    For Windows - C:\Users\USER_NAME\.m2
#
#    For Linux - /home/USER_NAME/.m2
#
#    If directory .m2 does not exist at you home directory, then you have to create new directory with name .m2
#
# You need to download file settings.xml from http://merle.felk.cvut.cz/redmine/attachments/download/71/settings.xml.
#
#    If file does not exist, then you can put there this file settings.xml.
#    If file exists, but is empty - <setting> element does not include some sub-element, then replace settings.xml file by this file settings.xml.
#    If file exist and <setting> element contains some sub-elements, then copy content of <setting> element from this file settings.xml.
